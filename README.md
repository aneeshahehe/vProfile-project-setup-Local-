Objectives:
* To create a Mutli-tier web application stack
* Pre-requisite setup for upcoming tasks
* Setup real world projects on local machine automatically

Problems: 
* Setup on Laptop/Desktop locally 
  - avoid making commits to a server due to insecurity
  - avoid commiting to a local stack due to
      - unrepeatability (if done manually)
      - time consumption
      - complexity (setting up a local server using VMs is complex)

Such a scenario creates problems.

Solution:

The Local Setup is automated, made repeatable with the use of Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC).

Tools:
* Hypervisor - Oracle VM VirtualBox
* Automation - Vagrant
* CLI - GitBash
* IDE - Visual Studio
